# 100-Days-Of-Python-Code
## 🎯 The Goal The objective of this challenge is to build a "coding habit" and a deep understanding of Python.  By the end of 100 days, I aim to: * Understand Python syntax and logic inside out. * Build a portfolio of 100 functional projects. * Transition from a beginner to a confident Python developer.
